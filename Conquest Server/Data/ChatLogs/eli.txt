[08/01/2013]-[23:45:47 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: but my dad just told me 
[08/01/2013]-[23:45:57 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: if you're going to upgrade you're os, you might aswell get a new comp 
[08/01/2013]-[23:46:02 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: and tbh i kinda believe that.. 
[08/01/2013]-[23:46:06 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: yeah

[08/01/2013]-[23:46:34 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: instead of spending $100 on something like windows 7  
[08/01/2013]-[23:46:52 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: i've thought about just going to linux too 
[08/01/2013]-[23:47:04 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: xp is fast  
[08/01/2013]-[23:47:06 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: faster than vista  
[08/01/2013]-[23:47:11 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: why  
[08/01/2013]-[23:47:24 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: no it's not lol 
[08/01/2013]-[23:47:31 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: linux is actually really good when you know how to use it  
[08/01/2013]-[23:47:32 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: no it's not 
[08/01/2013]-[23:47:35 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: lol

[08/01/2013]-[23:47:59 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: but 
[08/01/2013]-[23:48:02 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: only reason i didn't get it 
[08/01/2013]-[23:48:09 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: is cause i couldn't play the games i have on steam  
[08/01/2013]-[23:48:25 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: give my brother a windows based pc with 200 problems, he'll fix it in about

[08/01/2013]-[23:52:06 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: was like w95  
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:10 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: slowest thing i've ever seen  
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:10 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: but 
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:19 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: he wanted a pc that would run for yearssss 
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:23 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: and not have much trouble  
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:24 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: so 
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:31 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: we got him like a $2500 pc  
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:36 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: with a probably 
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:40 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: 30+ in monitor 
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:46 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: well

[08/01/2013]-[23:52:50 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: my dad found the deal 
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:51 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: he wanted it  
[08/01/2013]-[23:52:59 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: it was beastly  
[08/01/2013]-[23:53:11 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: you don't know the pc we got him  
[08/01/2013]-[23:53:14 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: you can't make that assumption  
[08/01/2013]-[23:53:33 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: my dad found the lowest deals  
[08/01/2013]-[23:53:35 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: he spends daysss

[08/01/2013]-[23:54:07 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: my dad got the best deal possible for the pc.  
[08/01/2013]-[23:54:15 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: that's not true. 
[08/01/2013]-[23:54:18 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: if it was  
[08/01/2013]-[23:54:21 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: people would buy all of it out 
[08/01/2013]-[23:54:23 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: and sell it here 
[08/01/2013]-[23:54:26 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: that wouldn't make sense 
[08/01/2013]-[23:54:31 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: that'd destoy the place that was selling it  
[08/01/2013]-[23:55:08 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: point being? 
[08/01/2013]-[23:55:12 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: there's different pc's for different things  
[08/01/2013]-[23:55:20 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: depending on the type of user you are.  
[08/01/2013]-[23:55:23 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: and if you want good parts  
[08/01/2013]-[23:55:26 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: that will last you for a long time  
[08/01/2013]-[23:55:30 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: they cost more money  
[08/01/2013]-[23:55:35 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: if you get cheapo parts  
[08/01/2013]-[23:55:46 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: something will happen with it down the road, eventually  
[08/01/2013]-[23:56:42 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: lol  
[08/01/2013]-[23:56:44 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: sorry   
[08/01/2013]-[23:56:44 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: but 
[08/01/2013]-[23:56:47 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: you'd lose 
[08/01/2013]-[23:56:48 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: big time  
[08/01/2013]-[23:56:48 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: ;p 
[08/01/2013]-[23:56:56 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: well  
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:08 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: they're both professionals in that stuff  
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:16 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: and  
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:19 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: they both have done pc repairs 
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:19 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: for years  
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:24 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: my dad's done it sense like  
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:25 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: 1999 
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:34 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: my dads been around pc's his whole life  
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:40 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: so has my bro 
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:52 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: my brother cleans about 
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:54 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: 10+ pc's everyday 
[08/01/2013]-[23:57:55 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: at his work  
[08/01/2013]-[23:58:49 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: but 
[08/01/2013]-[23:58:52 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: there's no way to tell who could win 
[08/01/2013]-[23:58:57 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: i'm just going by what i've seen 
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:04 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: and you're just going by what you've seen 
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:07 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: you can't compare the two 
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:10 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: when you haven't seen the other  
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:13 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: i've never seen you're work 
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:15 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: so i can't compare yours 
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:22 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: so on so fourth 
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:28 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: i consider my brother and dad good  
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:37 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: they're both professionals and done it their whole lifes  
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:41 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: that's what i'm going off of  
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:53 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: nah  
[08/01/2013]-[23:59:54 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: i'm fine

[09/01/2013]-[00:00:08 AM]: [50.83.231.20]: so basically  
[09/01/2013]-[00:00:14 AM]: [50.83.231.20]: this conversation is pretty much a waste of time  
[09/01/2013]-[00:00:20 AM]: [50.83.231.20]: cause there is no way to compare the two.  
[09/01/2013]-[00:00:46 AM]: [50.83.231.20]: portable or not?  
[09/01/2013]-[00:01:05 AM]: [50.83.231.20]: eh i bet i can get one for $50  
[09/01/2013]-[00:01:06 AM]: [50.83.231.20]: not sure though

[12/01/2013]-[16:40:22 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: i guess i usually just go by sound when i play  
[12/01/2013]-[16:40:28 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: i listen to something and try and get it as close as i can 
[12/01/2013]-[16:40:36 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: not that effective though 
[12/01/2013]-[16:41:47 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: i bet it'd be nice to be able to do though  
[12/01/2013]-[16:41:53 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: that's what the guy at our church does, that does our piano

[12/01/2013]-[16:42:08 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: he just listens to someone else play it  
[12/01/2013]-[16:42:15 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: and he just mimics it  
[12/01/2013]-[16:42:47 PM]: [50.83.231.20]: yeah
